    "Radiation losses, caused by radiative modes leaking out of a waveguide, do not generally affect perfectly guided waves. \n",
    "However, tight waveguide bends, which can be modeled as a deformation on the refractive index profile of the waveguide, make possible the excitation of radiative modes.\n",
    "In general, the lower the waveguide refractive index step, the higher the bend losses for a certain bend radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering losses are caused by waveguide discontinuities along the propagation direction, usually along the waveguide sidewalls, due to roughness originating from non-optimal etching processes during waveguide fabrication, and are the predominant losses for PICs.\n",
    "The magnitude of these losses depends on the optical size of the waveguide discontinuity, and thus scale with the size of discontinuity, its refractive index step, and inversely with wavelength.\n",
    "Roughness is usually determined by the waveguide fabrication process, and wavelength is determined by the application, but refractive index step can be tailored by selecting the materials forming the waveguide.\n",

    "Each of these structures scatters light, which interferes along its propagation, leading to light beams traveling in different directions.\n",

    "In reality, such grating devices are fabricated on a chip, and a substrate sits at a certain distance below the grating, separated by a low refractive index buffer layer to satisfy the waveguiding conditions.\n",
    "Part of the light is scattered below the grating, and some of it reflects up into the grating again, causing additional interference.\n",
    "This effect is commonly used to improve efficiency of grating couplers by selecting the distance between grating and substrate (or a mirror deposited above the substrate) so that constructive interference is obtained.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "It is important to note that this method approximates the scatterers as single-point sources (Rayleigh scattering), which scatter light spherically, and that it assumes that the wavelength of light in the material $\\lambda$ is shorter than the grating pitch $\\Lambda$.\n",
