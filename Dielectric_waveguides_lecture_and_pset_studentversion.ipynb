    "Radiation losses, caused by radiative modes leaking out of a waveguide, do not generally affect perfectly guided waves. \n",
    "However, tight waveguide bends, which can be modeled as a deformation on the refractive index profile of the waveguide, make possible the excitation of radiative modes.\n",
    "In general, the lower the waveguide refractive index step, the higher the bend losses for a certain bend radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering losses are caused by waveguide discontinuities along the propagation direction, usually along the waveguide sidewalls, due to roughness originating from non-optimal etching processes during waveguide fabrication, and are the predominant losses for PICs.\n",
    "The magnitude of these losses depends on the optical size of the waveguide discontinuity, and thus scale with the size of discontinuity, its refractive index step, and inversely with wavelength.\n",
    "Roughness is usually determined by the waveguide fabrication process, and wavelength is determined by the application, but refractive index step can be tailored by selecting the materials forming the waveguide.\n",
    "Scattering losses scale approximately with the square of the refractive index step, assuming constant roughness, wavelength, and electric field magnitude on the sidewalls. \n",

    "### 2.2. Diffraction gratings\n",
    "Diffraction gratings are optical components widely used in integrated photonics, as they enable light coupling in and out of the chip, and filtering.\n",
    "They are formed by a periodic structure, such as slits on a plane, dents in a mirror, or ridges in a waveguide.\n",
    "Each of these structures scatters light, which interferes along its propagation, leading to light beams traveling in different directions.\n",
    "The key properties of diffraction gratings can be easily understood by looking into wave interference, and we will follow this method here, as it gives a good approximation to their function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![gratings](T-grat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve constructive interference between two waves, their phase difference should be a multiple of $2\\pi$, and so the difference of the optical paths should be a multiple of the wavelength. \n",
    "If we assume an in-plane waveguide propagating light into a waveguide grating, for two grating teeth (assumed as point scatterers), the difference of the optical path is the difference between the distance traveled by the first scattered wave in air (blue line in figure) and the distance traveled by the rest of the wave along the waveguide until the next scatterer (orange line in figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the following grating equation,\n",

    "\n",
    "In reality, such grating devices are fabricated on a chip, and a substrate sits at a certain distance below the grating, separated by a low refractive index buffer layer to satisfy the waveguiding conditions.\n",
    "Part of the light is scattered below the grating, and some of it reflects up into the grating again, causing additional interference.\n",
    "This effect is commonly used to improve efficiency of grating couplers by selecting the distance between grating and substrate (or a mirror deposited above the substrate) so that constructive interference is obtained.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "It is important to note that this method approximates the scatterers as single-point sources (Rayleigh scattering), which scatter light spherically, and that it assumes that the wavelength of light in the material $\\lambda$ is shorter than the grating pitch $\\Lambda$.\n",
